      <p>
        There is sufficient evidence that repeated engagement using consistent
        key messaging is required for any behaviour to change, or to initiate
        new behaviour so that it becomes a practice. The various behaviour
        change communication activities of the strategy will address four key
        behaviours:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Compliance to Iron Folic Acid supplements and deworming</li>
          <li>
            Appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) with emphasis on
            adequate and age-appropriate complementary foods for children 6
            months and above
          </li>
          <li>
            Increase intake of iron-rich, protein-rich and vitamin C-rich foods
            through dietary diversification/quantity/frequency and food
            fortification
          </li>
          <li>
            Promoting practice of delayed cord clamping (by atleast 3 minutes or
            until cord pulsations cease) in all health facility deliveries
            followed by early initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth
          </li>
          Various activities prepared for behaviour change include sensitization
          meetings for the media, school teachers and administration, faith
          leaders, panchayat leaders, Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition
          Committee (VHSNC), etc.
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Year-round broadcast of messages for 'Anemia Mukt Bharat' should be
        carried out through mass media and social media (Whatsapp and Twitter).
      </p>
      <p>
        For community- and school-level communication, morning assemblies at
        schools will be utilized to discuss 'nutrition and anemia'. Youth
        festivals organized at school platform will also be utilized to generate
        discussions and dialogue on anemia and nutrition. Monthly meeting of
        ASHA and mothers' group will also be held at the existing platforms such
        as monthly Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) sites,
        monthly meetings as planned under Mother's Absolute Affection (MAA)
        programme, weekly Self Help Groups (SHGs) meeting under the State Rural
        Livelihood Mission (Maitri Baithaks), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Special press advertisements on occasions such as National Nutrition
        Week, National Deworming Day, Women's Day, World's Breastfeeding Week,
        and World Health Day including engagements with celebrities (local,
        national and international) will be used to amplify the communication
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comprehensive communication package for the strategy is available for
        use by the States which may be adapted as per requirement. These can be
        downloaded from the Anemia Mukt Bharat portal: www.anemiamuktbharat.info
      </p>
      <p>
        States can develop appropriate behaviour change communication plans
        through a range of communication channels such as using mass media
        through mobile phones, out-bound calls or text messages and interactive
        voice response system (IVRS), etc. as a need-based communication
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Promotion and monitoring of delayed clamping of the umbilical cord for
        at least 3 minutes (or until cord pulsations cease) for newborns across
        all health facilities will be carried out for improving the infant's
        iron reserves up to 6 months after birth. Simultaneously, all birth
        attendants should make an effort to ensure early initiation of
        breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth.

        Screening and testing of anemia is important in all age groups so that

        The strategy thus proposes the use of digital haemoglobinometers for
        haemoglobin level estimations (specifi cations at Annexure 4) in two
        benefi ciaries groups namely;
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            adolescent girls and boys 10-19 years, in government and
            government-aided schools
          </li>
          <li>
            pregnant women registered for antenatal check-ups. This may be
            extended to all age groups later.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        In-school adolescents will be screened by the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya
        Karyakram (RBSK) mobile teams using digital haemoglobinometers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schools should plan to sensitize the students and parents during Parent
        Teacher Meetings, about the planned health check-up by the RBSK teams,
        test and treat strategy for anemia and importance of diagnosis and
        control of anemia in adolescents for improvement in health and overall
        performance at schools. If needed, private schools should opt for
        informed consent of parents for Hb testing of adolescents.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the visit of RBSK team and screening of adolescents, a line list
        of identifi ed anemic adolescents prepared by RBSK teams will be shared
        with Nodal teacher/class teacher, so that the school can inform the
        parents as well as the nearby Sub-Centre/Primary Health Centre/Health
        and Wellness Centre for treatment, followup and dietary counselling.
        Parents should be counselled on the importance of compliance to
        treatment and regular followup along and adhere to the dosage regime, as
        well as Dos and Donâts as advised by the medical offi cer/nurse/ANM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Testing of anemia in pregnant women will be done using digital
        haemoglobinometers at all ANC contact points. At all high case load
        facilities at the block level and above, haemoglobin level estimation
        will be done using Semi-Auto Analyzers.

        <h5>Note</h5>
        For severely anemic pregnant women with haemoglobin less than 5 g/dl,
        immediate hospitalization irrespective of period of gestation where
        round-the-clock specialist care is available. This is to be done till
        normal level of haemoglobin is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Management protocol for severe anemia mentioned in Tables 6-8 is
        contraindicated for patients with thalassemia major and sickle cell
        disease. Treatment of anemia through folic acid is recommended in
        thalassemia major cases.

      <p>
        The strategy attempts to intensify awareness and integrate screening and
        treatment for following non-nutritional causes of anemia with special
        focus on malaria, haemoglobinopathies and fluorosis.
      </p>

      <h5>MALARIA:</h5>
      <p>
        As the country is committed towards malaria elimination by 2030, States
        have identifi ed high malaria-endemic districts/ blocks/sub-centres and
        villages for intensification of malaria prevention and control
        activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prevention and control strategy for nutritional anemia is to be
        integrated with active and passive case detection and management
        protocols as per the guidelines of National Vector Borne Disease Control
        Program (NVBDCP), MoHFW, GoI. The testing of malaria and anemia will be
        integrated in the identified malaria endemic regions, e.g., the
        beneficiaries who report recent fever and being screened for anemia will
        also be tested for malaria as per NVBDCP guidelines, to ascertain the
        co- occurrence of malaria. Similarly, patients who are being tested for
        malaria will also be tested for anemia in these endemic regions with
        increase in outreach under NVBDCP programme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixed days for screening of anemia at Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva
        Abhiyan (PMSMA) sites and annually by Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram
        teams in schools will be utilized to provide screening for malaria as
        per NVBDCP, MoHFW guidelines. The treatment protocol for management of
        anemia in malaria-endemic regions will be the same as given in Tables 6
        and 7 for children and adolescents. For treating malaria in pregnant
        women, the protocol issued by NVBDCP will be followed including
        Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) for treatment of P. falciparum
        malaria as per drug policy of NVBDCP for treatment of malaria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) before and after the monsoon season will be
        carried out with the appropriate insecticides in school premises and
        residential areas as per the malaria burden as decided by NVBDCP. To
        prevent malaria, NVBDCP has provided Long Lasting Insecticide Nets
        (LLINs) in all high endemic areas. Anaemia Mukt Bharat will play a key
        role for utilization of these LLINs by all target groups especially
        pregnant mothers and under-five children by promoting IEC/BCC.
      </p>
      <h5>HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES:</h5>
      <p>
        An integrated strategy for comprehensive prevention, screening and
        management of haemoglobinopathies should be provided at the existing
        service delivery platforms. Pre-marital and pre-conception screening and
        counselling services for informing the community about appropriate
        preventive options will be provided in the endemic districts of the
        country. Existing platforms such as AWCs, SCs and Health and Wellness
        Centres and events such as VHNDs, Nutrition week, Breastfeeding week,
        Women's Day, World Thalassemia Day, etc. will be utilized to generate
        discussions and dialogue on nonnutritional causes of anemia in the
        endemic districts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities such as quizzes and assisted educative talks (with
        distribution of informative booklets) can be done during Adolescent
        Health Days to engage adolescents. Screening for haemoglobinopathies
        should be integrated with ANC services during the first trimester of
        pregnancy in the endemic districts. Women identified with severe anemia
        should be referred to higher centres for further investigations and if
        found positive, the husband is to be screened for carrier status. If the
        couple is found positive, they are to be referred to a higher centre for
        prenatal diagnosis before twenty weeks of pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Appropriate treatment should be provided as per the National Guidelines
        on Prevention and Control of Haemoglobinopathies (2016).6 The treatment
        of anemia using parental iron administration is contraindicated in
        sickle cell disease patients.
      </p>

      <h5>FLUOROSIS:</h5>
      <p>
        High fluoride concentration in food and water leads to destruction of
        gastrointestinal mucosa, thus reducing the nutrient absorption,
        including iron and folic acid. The National Programme for Prevention and
        Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF)7 is coordinating action on the fluorosis
        issue across the country. The programme recognizes the linkages of
        fluoride, anemia and malnutrition, and recommends a combined approach of
        safe drinking water and nutritional therapy to treat the people affected
        with problems of anemia due to fluorosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Addressing anemia due to fluorosis will need sustained communication,
        behaviour change and a combined approach of safe drinking water along
        with nutritional improvements. This can be achieved through the existing
        implementation framework of the NPPCF under NHM and through convergence
        with other departments such as the PHE at the district level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 3 key interventions are:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h6>Identification of fluoride-affected habitations:</h6>
            States should identify the habitations with high anemia and
            fluorosis prevalence. List of fluorosis-endemic districts/blocks of
            the country as available with the NPPCF Division, MoHFW is at
            Annexure 5. States should converge with the PHED departments to
            produce local mapping of high fluoride-affected habitations through
            this process for planning purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>Activities for anemia control due to fluorosis:</h6>
            The recommended activities for anemia prevention and control due to
            fluorosis is to be taken up in these habitations through counselling
            services in the community, such as use of safe drinking water, focus
            on diet corrections (Calcium, Magnesium, Vitamin C) by dietary
            diversity, etc. These counselling process to be made systemic within
            the district level by establishing local protocols for anemia and
            fluorosis control. Counselling services should also include periodic
            check-up of haemoglobin in affected habitations and seek appropriate
            treatment for the same. Subsequently, IFA supplementation is to be
            initiated after correction of anemia status through these fluorosis
            control activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>Capacity building:</h6>
            Within fluoride-affected blocks, training of all public health
            staff, such as MO in PHC/CHC, field workers (ASHA, ANM and AWW) and
            others should be conducted on aspects of communication and behaviour
            change of anemia and fluoride control, with the broad message of
            âAccha Paani, Takatvar Paaniâ signifying health and nutritional
            improvements through water.
